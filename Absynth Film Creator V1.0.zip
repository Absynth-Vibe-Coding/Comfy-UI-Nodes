Just extract the Zip into your \ComfyUI\custom_nodes

NOTE: Presets only save after you click Run. Presets only update after you restart Comfy. You can`t edit all presets right now - you must set preset to custom, or edit them in the json file.

UPDATE: There is a workaround for editing all presets: just chain 2 of the nodes togehter https://github.com/Absynth-Vibe-Coding/Comfy-UI-Nodes/blob/main/absynth-film-look-creator-node-comfy-ui_5.png
In the first node set the preset to custom and in the second choose a preset, then you can make changes in the first node - run and that will change the preset.
