AI Vibed Coded Nodes for Comfy UI

<strong><h2>Absynth Film Look Creator v1.0 - A ComfyUI Node</h2></strong>
Crafting a cinematic aesthetic for your digital art.

The Absynth Film Look Creator is a custom ComfyUI & fully AI Vibe Coded Node, to elevate your digital renders with professional-grade cinematic qualities. This tool provides a comprehensive suite of controls for film emulation and atmospheric enhancement, allowing you to move beyond simple filters and achieve a truly distinctive visual style. Inspired by the rich, imperfect character of analog film and classic cinematography, it offers precise control over every aspect of your image's look and feel.

Important Note: This is the initial public release (v1.0). Currently, presets are applied and saved upon node execution ("Run"). I am actively working on improving the user interface and functionality in future updates to provide a more streamlined workflow.

<br> <br>


<strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is a workaround for editing all presets: just chain 2 of the nodes togehter 
<img src="https://github.com/Absynth-Vibe-Coding/Comfy-UI-Nodes/blob/main/absynth-film-look-creator-node-comfy-ui_5.png">
In the first node set the preset to custom and in the second choose a preset, then you can make changes in the first node - run and that will change the preset.
