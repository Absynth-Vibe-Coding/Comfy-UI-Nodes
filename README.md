<strong><h2>Absynth Film Look Creator v1.0 - A ComfyUI Node</h2></strong>
<strong>Crafting a cinematic aesthetic for your digital art!</strong>

The Absynth Film Look Creator is a custom ComfyUI & fully AI Vibe Coded Node, to elevate your digital renders with professional-grade cinematic qualities. This tool provides a comprehensive suite of controls for film emulation and atmospheric enhancement, allowing you to move beyond simple filters and achieve a truly distinctive visual style. Inspired by the rich, imperfect character of analog film and classic cinematography, it offers precise control over every aspect of your image's look and feel.

<strong>Key Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Color & Tonal Grading:</strong> Precisely adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, temperature, and tint to perform professional color correction and set the overall mood of your scene.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Film Emulation & LUTs:</strong> Emulate the unique characteristics of analog film with controls for grain intensity and a customizable vignette. This node allows you to import and apply your own custom LUT files (.cube format) to instantly transform the color and tone of your renders. The LUT intensity slider provides precise control over the strength of the applied LUT.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Lens & Atmospheric Effects:</strong> Introduce subtle imperfections and artistic flares with chromatic aberration and halation intensity. Fine-tune the visual atmosphere using clarity and bloom to control sharpness and light diffusion.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Highlight & Shadow Control:</strong> Gain granular control over the image's tonal range by defining shadow tint color and highlight tint color. Adjust their influence with dedicated intensity sliders for precise stylistic control.</li>

<p>Important Note: This is the initial public release (v1.0). Currently, presets are applied and saved upon node execution ("Run"). I am actively working on improving the user interface and functionality in future updates to provide a more streamlined workflow.</p>

<br>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is a workaround for editing all presets: just chain 2 of the nodes together. <br>

<p>In the first node set the preset to custom and in the second choose a preset, then you can make changes in the first node - run and that will change the preset.</p>
