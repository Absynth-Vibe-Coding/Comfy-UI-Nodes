# 🎛️ ComfyUI Workflows by Absynth

Welcome to my **ComfyUI Workflows** collection ✨  
This folder contains ready-to-use, experimental, and sometimes slightly unhinged workflows for **ComfyUI**.

If it renders, glitches, dances, or does something cool — it probably belongs here.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

You’ll find workflows for things like:

- 🎬 **Text-to-Video & Image-to-Video**
- 🎶 **Music, rhythm & vibe-based experiments**
- 🧪 **Experimental nodes, cursed ideas, and happy accidents**
- 🛠️ **Optimized setups for real-world use with 16 gb vram ;-)

Some workflows are **clean & production-ready**  
Some are **“it works, don’t touch it”**  
All of them are made with caffeine and a lot of hours spent.

## ⚠️ Requirements

- Latest **ComfyUI**
- Required custom nodes (check workflow load errors)
- A GPU that doesn’t scream immediately (optional but recommended)
- recommended: SageAttention 2.2 with Triton <- you dont know how to install it? Make a backup of your comfy first and then let it Claude Code do for you!
  

If ComfyUI complains:
> “Missing node XYZ”

That’s normal.  
Install the node, reload, try again.  
Repeat until happiness.

## 📺 Important (Very Serious) Request

If you enjoy these workflows, learn something new, or laugh at least once:

👉 **SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel:**

I post:
- ComfyUI tutorials
- Workflow breakdowns
- AI video & music experiments
- Bugs turning into features

Your GPU will thank you.  
Your future self will too.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “If it looks stupid but works, it’s not stupid.”  
> — Ancient ComfyUI proverb (probably)

Feel free to:
- Modify
- Remix
- Break
- Improve
- Evolve these workflows

Just don’t blame me if your render queue never ends.
